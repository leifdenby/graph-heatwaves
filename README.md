This directory contains the model implementation of the following paper.
<Regional heatwave prediction using weather station data and Graph Neural Network>
By Peiyuan Li, Yin Yu, Daning Huang, Ashish Sharma, Zhi-Hua Wang
The GNN model is implemented using PyTorch Geometric (PyG) (Fey & Lenssen, 2019), an open-source machine learning framework with Graph Network architectures built upon PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019)
